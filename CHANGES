   beancount: CHANGES
========================

2014-11-09

  - A new directive has been created: "plugin" that accepts the an optional
    plugin-configuration string. Instead of

      option "plugin" "<module>"
      option "plugin" "<module>:<config>"

    Now use:

      plugin "<module>"
      plugin "<module>" "<config>"

    The plugin option will remain functional for a while. The configuration
    string is as previously a free-form string whose meaning is to be defined by
    the plugin itself.

  - The parser now stores the distribution of the precisions of all the numbers
    it parses, and this adds a little bit of overhead (about 4%). With a large
    file, you might notice a little tiny bit of extra slowness. The reason I
    created this is in order to automatically infer reasonable defaults for the
    display precision (used in the SQL shell at the moment).

  - Renamed the 'bean-query' tool to 'bean-report'. There is a good reason for
    this: there is a new tool coming that will provide an command-shell to make
    interactive queries on your ledger contents. This tool will be
    called--appropriately--"bean-query". I decided that the two tools should be
    separate: "bean-report" will be used to render custom-coded reports (nothing
    changes), and "bean-query" will be used to build reports out of SQL-like
    queries. I'm hoping that eventually bean-query functionality will entirely
    subsume bean-report reports, but that is unclear at this point.

  - Made default rendering for changes and balances of HTML reports by units().
    Rendering all the lots was horrible in even moderately complex stock trading
    accounts with a few positions. Now we aggregate by currency ("units").

     In order for the user to be able to view the previously available lot
     detail from the web interface, we now provide a link to the "context",
     which is a link specific to a transaction that renders the balances for all
     the accounts just before the transaction is applied, and just after.

  - (Internal) Renamed beancount.core.complete to beancount.core.interpolate.
    I've been using the term interpolate for a while now, in the docs, and it's
    way more telling than complete.
