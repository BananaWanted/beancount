  - Added a new "beancount.plugins.ira_contribs" module that automatically
    inserts postings for tracking pre-tax money contributions.

  - The precision of rendered numbers isn't quantized nor subject to hard-coded
    maximums anymore. I cleaned this up. There is a new "DisplayContext" object
    that maintains the most common and maximum precisions to be used to render
    each currency, and this precision is derived automatically from the numbers
    used in the input file (the most common is the mode of the distribution of
    numbers seen). The alignment of the printer's amounts is now also fixed (it
    rendered correct transactions lately but alignment was a little borked), and
    the output is now kept as tightly as possible close to the account names.

  - Numbers don't render with commas by default anymore. There is a new option:
    'render_commas' that you can set to have commas in numbers rendered in all
    the routines that output numbers.

  - A new directive has been created: "plugin" that accepts the an optional
    plugin-configuration string. Instead of

      option "plugin" "<module>"
      option "plugin" "<module>:<config>"

    Now use:

      plugin "<module>"
      plugin "<module>" "<config>"

    The plugin option will remain functional for a while. The configuration
    string is as previously a free-form string whose meaning is to be defined by
    the plugin itself.

  - The parser now stores the distribution of the precisions of all the numbers
    it parses, and this adds a little bit of overhead (about 4%). With a large
    file, you might notice a little tiny bit of extra slowness. The reason I
    created this is in order to automatically infer reasonable defaults for the
    display precision (used in the SQL shell at the moment).

  - Renamed the 'bean-query' tool to 'bean-report'. There is a good reason for
    this: there is a new tool coming that will provide an command-shell to make
    interactive queries on your ledger contents. This tool will be
    called--appropriately--"bean-query". I decided that the two tools should be
    separate: "bean-report" will be used to render custom-coded reports (nothing
    changes), and "bean-query" will be used to build reports out of SQL-like
    queries. I'm hoping that eventually bean-query functionality will entirely
    subsume bean-report reports, but that is unclear at this point.

  - Made default rendering for changes and balances of HTML reports by units().
    Rendering all the lots was horrible in even moderately complex stock trading
    accounts with a few positions. Now we aggregate by currency ("units").

     In order for the user to be able to view the previously available lot
     detail from the web interface, we now provide a link to the "context",
     which is a link specific to a transaction that renders the balances for all
     the accounts just before the transaction is applied, and just after.

  - (Internal) Renamed beancount.core.complete to beancount.core.interpolate.
    I've been using the term interpolate for a while now, in the docs, and it's
    way more telling than complete.
