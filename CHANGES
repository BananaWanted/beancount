   beancount: CHANGES
========================
Note: This file contains only changes in the 'default' branch.

  - Completed work on calculating returns (merged branch 'returns' into
    default). I created a new package called "projects" to hold these special
    tasks, those that don't integrate in the plugins framework, and created a
    beancount.projects.returns library that can be inovoked as a script, like
    this:

      python3 -m beancount.projects.returns <filename.beancount> ...

    For the arguments, you will have to read the docstring. You essentially need
    to provide two or three regular expressions to list the set of accounts
    that define you portfolio as well as other lists of accounts that should be
    considered internal flows. See the docstring for details. I will eventually
    move much of that explanation into a Google Doc and detail it in more depth.

    There is also a script that runs it on the example beancount file, as well
    as examples in the unit tests.

  - Started the "booking" branch which will implement the
    http://furius.ca/beancount/doc/proposal-booking proposal. The first step was
    to add an argument to the Open directive to specify the default booking
    method to use when there are either 0, 2 or more matching lots in an
    inventory. The only value supported by this are currently "STRICT" (the
    default) or "NONE" which effectively disables inventory booking and is
    equivalent to Ledger's method of accumulating lots. The new syntax looked
    like this and is backward compatible with previous synta for it:

      YYYY-MM-DD open <account>   [<commodities>]  ["<booking-method>"]

    Though the result may be inventories with positive and negative positions in
    the same commodity, this is useful for working with accounts booked at their
    average cost (until we have correct treatment of basis for those with
    dedicated syntax for merging lots). The total number of units and the total
    cost should be correct.

    This state of the 'booking' branch was merged into the 'default' branch,
    which is why it appears in this CHANGE entry.

  - Merged "metadata" branch into default, Beancount now parses the metadata but
    does not store it anywhere. This was done so that early adopters can start
    to enter metadata right away even if it is not usable yet.


2014-11-13

  - Added a new "beancount.plugins.ira_contribs" module that automatically
    inserts postings for tracking pre-tax money contributions.

  - The precision of rendered numbers isn't quantized nor subject to hard-coded
    maximums anymore. I cleaned this up. There is a new "DisplayContext" object
    that maintains the most common and maximum precisions to be used to render
    each currency, and this precision is derived automatically from the numbers
    used in the input file (the most common is the mode of the distribution of
    numbers seen). The alignment of the printer's amounts is now also fixed (it
    rendered correct transactions lately but alignment was a little borked), and
    the output is now kept as tightly as possible close to the account names.

  - Numbers don't render with commas by default anymore. There is a new option:
    'render_commas' that you can set to have commas in numbers rendered in all
    the routines that output numbers.

  - A new directive has been created: "plugin" that accepts the an optional
    plugin-configuration string. Instead of

      option "plugin" "<module>"
      option "plugin" "<module>:<config>"

    Now use:

      plugin "<module>"
      plugin "<module>" "<config>"

    The plugin option will remain functional for a while. The configuration
    string is as previously a free-form string whose meaning is to be defined by
    the plugin itself.

  - The parser now stores the distribution of the precisions of all the numbers
    it parses, and this adds a little bit of overhead (about 4%). With a large
    file, you might notice a little tiny bit of extra slowness. The reason I
    created this is in order to automatically infer reasonable defaults for the
    display precision (used in the SQL shell at the moment).

  - Renamed the 'bean-query' tool to 'bean-report'. There is a good reason for
    this: there is a new tool coming that will provide an command-shell to make
    interactive queries on your ledger contents. This tool will be
    called--appropriately--"bean-query". I decided that the two tools should be
    separate: "bean-report" will be used to render custom-coded reports (nothing
    changes), and "bean-query" will be used to build reports out of SQL-like
    queries. I'm hoping that eventually bean-query functionality will entirely
    subsume bean-report reports, but that is unclear at this point.

  - Made default rendering for changes and balances of HTML reports by units().
    Rendering all the lots was horrible in even moderately complex stock trading
    accounts with a few positions. Now we aggregate by currency ("units").

     In order for the user to be able to view the previously available lot
     detail from the web interface, we now provide a link to the "context",
     which is a link specific to a transaction that renders the balances for all
     the accounts just before the transaction is applied, and just after.

  - (Internal) Renamed beancount.core.complete to beancount.core.interpolate.
    I've been using the term interpolate for a while now, in the docs, and it's
    way more telling than complete.
