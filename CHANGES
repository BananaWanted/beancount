   beancount: CHANGES
========================

2014-11-09

  - Made default rendering for changes and balances of HTML reports by units().
    Rendering all the lots was horrible in even moderately complex stock trading
    accounts with a few positions. Now we aggregate by currency ("units").

     In order for the user to be able to view the previously available lot
     detail from the web interface, we now provide a link to the "context",
     which is a link specific to a transaction that renders the balances for all
     the accounts just before the transaction is applied, and just after.

  (Beginning to summarize user-facing changes here.)
