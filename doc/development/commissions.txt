Some more thinking about this: one possible method would be to allow the user to
indicate that a particular leg of the transaction is meant to be folded into the
cost of another leg's, something I would implement like the following.

First let's make up an example of a transaction the way they're currently done,
with the full capital gain, that is, one that unfairly (to you) includes
commissions:

2014-06-13 * "Transactions with Commissions"
  Assets:US:Invest:Cash            -5009.95 USD                  ;  5009.95 USD
  Expenses:US:Invest:Commissions       9.95 USD                  ;     9.95 USD
  Assets:US:Invest:HOOL               10.00 HOOL {500.00 USD}    ;  5000.00 USD

2014-06-20 * "Transactions with Commissions"
  Assets:US:Invest:HOOL              -10.00 HOOL {500.00 USD}    ; -5000.00 USD
  Expenses:US:Invest:Commissions       9.95 USD                  ;     9.95 USD
  Assets:US:Invest:Cash             5090.05 USD                  ;  5090.05 USD
  Income:US:Invest:PnL              -100.00 USD                  ;  -100.00 USD

This is what we need to fix, we want the gain to become 100 USD - 2 x 9.95 USD.

So now let's introduce a flag into the cost syntax (there's already a flag
available on each posting):

2014-06-13 * "Transactions with Commissions"
  Assets:US:Invest:Cash              -5009.95 USD                  ;  5009.95 USD
  + Expenses:US:Invest:Commissions       9.95 USD                  ;     0.00 USD (+)
  Assets:US:Invest:HOOL                 10.00 HOOL {500.00 USD +}  ;  5009.95 USD =  10.00 HOOL {500.995 USD}

2014-06-20 * "Transactions with Commissions"
  Assets:US:Invest:HOOL                -10.00 HOOL {2014-06-13 -}  ; -5009.95 USD = -10.00 HOOL {500.995 USD}
  - Expenses:US:Invest:Commissions       9.95 USD                  ;     0.00 USD (-)
  Assets:US:Invest:Cash               5090.05 USD                  ;  5090.05 USD
  Income:US:Invest:PnL                 -80.10 USD                  ;   -80.10 USD

When a flag is encountered in the cost, this says, add to the total cost the
amount from postings marked with that flag. In the case of the buy, this
means (500.00 x 10 + 9.95) is the new total cost and the cost per unit is now
500.995 USD. This works to give you a capital gain as you desired.

However, here are some drawbacks:

- You cannot use the cost basis of the lot to identify it anymore (the lot is
  now at a different cost basis, 500.995 USD instead of 500.00 USD, and that
  amounts shows up nowhere, we cannot realistically expect the user to know it).

  That may not be a bad thing though, I never liked identifying lots by their
  cost in the first place, I prefer a method that uses a label or the date to
  disambiguate. When reducing a position, the purpose of that cost really is
  just to identify which lot we should be using to reduce the position. I
  already have a proposal to make this better, by using labels or dates instead
  of cost (see sale transaction).

- A bigger problem, however, and one that is preventing me from fully going
  ahead with this idea just yet, is that the expenses are gone. The expenses leg
  just cannot post to the commissions account, because its amount has been
  incorporated into the cost of the position. Allowing the cost to show up in
  both places would break the accounting equation; this transaction must balance.

Maybe we should add an Income leg to absord the Expenses amount and post it
anyhow?

2014-06-13 * "Transactions with Commissions"
  Assets:US:Invest:Cash              -5009.95 USD                  ;  5009.95 USD
  + Expenses:US:Invest:Commissions       9.95 USD                  ;     0.00 USD (+)
  + Income:US:Invest:Commissions-Rebate
  Assets:US:Invest:HOOL                 10.00 HOOL {500.00 USD +}  ;  5009.95 USD =  10.00 HOOL {500.995 USD}

I'm not quite sure how to solve this yet.

Ideas welcome,
