This directory used to contain the documentation for Beancount.
All the documentation has been migrated to Google Docs.

You can access the index via a redirect to the documentation here:

  http://furius.ca/beancount/doc/index

Or directly, here (same doc):

  https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RaondTJCS_IUPBHFNdT8oqFKJjVJDsfsn6JEjBG04eA/

The only local documentation that remains here is a cheatsheet.
