Upload balance sheet holdings to a Google Spreadsheet.

I want to automate the upload of my list of assets and liabilities to a Google
Sheet. In particular, I want it to update a single sheet in the same,
pre-existing spreadsheet document so that I can build various types of live
reports in the spreadsheet by accessing particular columns in the first sheet.
The update must occur in place.

Another big advantage of this export method is that unlike an OFX export to
Google Finance, this does not involve any manual steps. It can be fully
automated via its API.

Note that the ultimate goal is to be able to do this from the SQL shell
directly. I'll eventually evolve the shell to support joins and to be able to
flatten directory contents, so that a single expression, albeit large and
complex, could generate this entire report to a CSV file and perhaps the shell
itself could support an URI syntax to upload to a sheet directly.
