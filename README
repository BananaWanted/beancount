Description
===========

A double-entry bookkeeping computer language, that lets you define financial
transaction records in a text file, read them into memory, and generate a
variety of output reports from a web interface. This project

- Defines a set of very simple core data structures, a language and an
  associated parser. You should be able to read the input file and easily
  process its contents.

- A web front-end which renders a variety of common reports.

- Tools to help you import and file CSV, OFX and other files downloaded from
  various financial institutions.

- This is 2.0 version, a complete clean-room rewrite of Beancount 1.0.

Project Status
==============

Beancount v2 is now the only beancount as of summer 2013. It's a full rewrite,
stable and I'm using only this version now, it is maintained, and I have 7-8
years worth of my personal data relying on it and use it every week or two. It
works.


Dependencies
============

For users:

- Python 3.3 or above. IMPORTANT: Python 3.2 will not work.
- cdecimal (optional but strongly suggested, a faster Decimal type for Python)
- Bottle (a tiny web server, pure Python)
- BeautifulSoup (v4) - for Import only
- sqlite3 and Pandas (OPTIONAL: only for calculating and rendering positions)

For developers:

- GNU flex and GNU bison (to build the parser)


Installation
============

Development Installation
------------------------

If you just want to try it out without installing, build the extension in-place
like this::

  python3 setup.py build_ext -i

Then add the clone's path to the PYTHONPATH variable::

  export PYTHONPATH=..../beancount/src/python

You should be able to run the executables under `..../beancount/bin`


Setup Installation
------------------

If you want to install this in your Python installation, try this::

  sudo python3 setup.py install

Or, equivalently::

  sudo pip3 setup.py install

These commands should build the extension module and install Beancount in your
Python library path.


Download
========

You can obtain the source code from a Mercurial repository, found at:

  http://hg.furius.ca/public/beancount/

Download it like this:

  hg clone --insecure http://hg.furius.ca/public/beancount/

(Use the --insecure flag because I sometimes have a self-signed SSL certificate
on my server.)

This is the authoritative location for the latest version. I don't use github--I
roll my own Mercurial server. github clones are probably out of date, clone from
the URL above.

Documentation
=============

- `CHANGES <CHANGES>`_
- `TODO <TODO>`_

I have yet to write full documentation, but basically, there are two main
programs that you should care about:

  bean-check: Checks for errors in a Beancount input file.
  bean-web: Starts a local web server so you can browse a Beancount ledger.

All the other are toy tools.

Check out the examples for now in order to get a sense of how this works.
There is also a cheatsheet under doc/cheatsheet.org.
