Description
===========

A double-entry bookkeeping computer language that lets you define financial
transaction records in a text file, read them in memory, generate a variety of
reports from them, and provides a web interface. This project

Beancount 2.0-beta is the only beancount as of Summer 2013. It's a full rewrite
of version 1.0, very stable, and I'm using only this version now, it is
maintained, and I have 7-8 years worth of my personal data relying on it and use
it every week or two in many ways. This is an actively developed project; it
works.


Documentation
=============

- `CHANGES <CHANGES>`_
- `TODO <TODO>`_

Documentation lives on Google Docs. You can find an index to all the available
documents here:

  http://furius.ca/beancount/doc/index

(IMPORTANT NOTE [2014-07-13]: Documentation is being written this summer. You
may find the current state of the documentation in-progress. I'm focusing hard
on this and hope to be done before September 2014.)

Discussions about Beancount occur on the `Ledger mailing-list
<https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/ledger-cli>`_, which has become the *de
facto* discussion group for all command-line accounting softwares.


Download
========

You can obtain the source code from a Mercurial repository, found at:

  http://hg.furius.ca/public/beancount/

This is the authoritative location for the latest version. There is also a
mirror at bitbucket that has a snazzier web interface, that I try to regularly
push changes to:

  http://bitbucket.org/blais/beancount/

Download it like this:

  hg clone http://hg.furius.ca/public/beancount/

I don't use github. github clones that can be found in the wild are probably out
of date, you should clone from the URL above.

Dependencies
============

For users:

- Python 3.3 or above.
- cdecimal (optional but strongly suggested, for performance)
- Bottle (a tiny web server, pure Python)
- wget (to bake reports to a zip file)

You can install some of those using pip3 (cdecimal appears to require an
otherwise straightforward install from source).

For developers:

- GNU flex and bison (to build the parser)
- lxml
- nosetests (to run the unit tests)
- pylint >=1.2 (to run the linter)
- snakefood (for unused imports check)
- graphviz (for graphing module dependencies)


Installation
============

Installation instructions are under beancount/install.
