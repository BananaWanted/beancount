Description
===========

A double-entry bookkeeping computer language, that lets you define financial
transaction records in a text file, read them into memory, and generate a
variety of output reports from a web interface. This project

- Defines a set of very simple core data structures, a language and an
  associated parser. You should be able to read the input file and easily
  process its contents.

- A web front-end which renders a variety of common reports.

- Tools to help you import and file CSV, OFX and other files downloaded from
  various financial institutions.

- This is a 2.0 version, a complete clean-room rewrite of Beancount 1.0.

Project Status
==============

Beancount v2 is now the only beancount as of summer 2013. It's a full rewrite,
stable and I'm using only this version now, it is maintained, and I have 7-8
years worth of my personal data relying on it and use it every week or two. It
works.


Dependencies
============

For users:

- Python 3.3 or above.
- cdecimal (optional but strongly suggested, for performance)
- Bottle (a tiny web server, pure Python)
- wget (to bake reports to a zip file)

You can install some of those using pip3 (cdecimal appears to require an
otherwise straightforward install from source).

For developers:

- GNU flex and bison (to build the parser)
- lxml
- nosetests (to run the unit tests)
- pylint >=1.2 (to run the linter)
- snakefood (for unused imports check)


Installation
============

Installation instructions are under beancount/install.


Download
========

You can obtain the source code from a Mercurial repository, found at:

  http://hg.furius.ca/public/beancount/

Download it like this:

  hg clone --insecure http://hg.furius.ca/public/beancount/

(Use the --insecure flag because I sometimes have a self-signed SSL certificate
on my server.)

This is the authoritative location for the latest version. I don't use github--I
roll my own Mercurial server. github clones are probably out of date, clone from
the URL above.

Documentation
=============

- `CHANGES <CHANGES>`_
- `TODO <TODO>`_

Discussions about Beancount occur on the `Ledger mailing-list
<https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/ledger-cli>`_, which has become the *de
facto* discussion group for all command-line accounting softwares.

I have yet to write full documentation, but basically, there are two main
programs that you should care about:

  bean-check: Checks for errors in a Beancount input file.
  bean-web: Starts a local web server so you can browse a Beancount ledger.

All the other are toy tools.

Check out the examples for now in order to get a sense of how this works.
There is also a cheatsheet under doc/cheatsheet.org.
