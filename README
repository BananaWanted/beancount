.. important::

   This project, which has long been stable and in active use, is currently
   being rewritten from scratch (2013-06-01). The new version (v2) will provide
   most of the features that 'beancount' did, and much more, with simpler data
   structures and a better implementation. Beancount development will remain
   here for the foreseeable future, under branch 'v1'.

Description
===========

A double-entry bookkeeping computer language, that lets you define financial
transaction records in a text file, read them into memory, and generate a
variety of output reports from a web interface. This project

- Defines a set of very simple core data structures, a language and an
  associated parser. You should be able to read the input file and easily
  process its contents.

- A web front-end which renders a variety of common reports.

- Tools to help you import and manage files downloaded from various financial
  institutions.

Project Status
==============

Beancount v2 is now the only beancount as of summer 2013. It's a full rewrite,
stable and I'm using only this version now, it is maintained, and I have 7-8
years worth of my personal data relying on it. This works.



Dependencies
============

For users:

- Python 3.3 or above. IMPORTANT: Python 3.2 will not work.
- cdecimal (optional but strongly suggested, a faster Decimal type for Python)
- Bottle (a tiny web server, pure Python)
- BeautifulSoup (v4) - for Import only
- sqlite3 and Pandas (OPTIONAL: only for calculating and rendering positions)

For developers:

- GNU flex and GNU bison (to build the parser)


Download
========

A Mercurial repository can be found at:

  http://hg.furius.ca/public/beancount/

This is the authoritative location for the latest version. I don't use github--I
roll my own Mercurial server. github clones are probably out of date, clone from
the URL above.
