This directory contains custom tools used for development of Beancount itself.
These are strictly developer tools and should never be installed nor packaged.
These tools operate on the source code either to make automated adjustments or
apply constraints or verifications. Invoked from the root Makefile.

For the Beancount binaries, see /bin.
