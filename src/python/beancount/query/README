TODO list for BQL:

- Compute the special 'balance' row and produce journals with it.


- Render with custom routine, not beancount.reports.table

  * Find a way to pipe into treeify
  * Deal with rendering on multiple lines, e.g., for inventories with multiple positions

- Make it possible to run from the command-line in batch mode


- Implement set variables for format and verbosity and display precision and what-not
- Implement JOURNAL account FROM
- Implement BALANCES FROM



* Ideas and Improvements for Query Language

  - Support matching on other than Transactions instances.

  - You could apply an early limit only if sorting is not requested, stopping
    after the limit number of rows.

  - Implement and support the ResultSetEnvironment for nested select quereis.
    (Actually allow evaluating the SQL against generic rows of datasets.)

  - New columns and functions:
    * Add date() function to create dates from a dateutil string
    * Support simple mathematical operations, +, - , /.
    * Implement set operations, "in" for sets
    * Implement globbing matches
