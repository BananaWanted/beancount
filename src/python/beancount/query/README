TODO list for BQL:

- Compute the special 'balance' row and produce journals with it.

- Apply early limit only if sorting is not requested.

    if query.limit and len(result_rows) == query.limit:
        raise StopIteration

- Add PAGER in rendering code.

- Implement and support the ResultSetEnvironment
  (Actually allow evaluating the SQL against generic rows of datasets.)

FIXME: Deal with sum of inventory, compile special nodes SumPosition(), SumInventory().

FIXME:

- Render with custom routine, not beancount.reports.table

- Deal with rendering on multiple lines, e.g., for inventories with multiple positions


- Make it possible to run from the command-line in batch mode

- Implement set variables for format and verbosity and display precision and what-not
- Implement JOURNAL account FROM
- Implement BALANCES FROM

- Invoke a pager when long output
  * Find a way to pipe into treeify

- Implement order by
- Implement limit
- Implement distinct
- Removed case-sensitivity of regexps?

New columns and functions:
- Add date() function to create dates from a dateutil string
- Support simple mathematical operations, +, - , /.
- Implement set operations, "in" for sets
- Implement globbing matches
