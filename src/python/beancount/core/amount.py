"""Amount class.

This simple class is used to associate a number of units of a currency with its
currency:

  (number, currency).

The module also contains the basic Decimal type import.

About Decimal usage:

- Do not import Decimal from 'decimal' or 'cdecimal' modules; always import your
  Decimal class from beancount.core.amount.


- Prefer to use D() to create new instances of Decimal objects, which
  handles more syntax, e.g., handles None, and numbers with commas.

import re

# Attempt to import a fast Decimal implementation; if we can't, fall back on the
# slower pure-Python Decimal object. Note that because of the small and
# occasional discrepancies between these two modules, we may have to work with
# the common denominator between these two. This is only a very minor compromise
# though, they have 99% compatible.
